# CreyonEngine
CreyonEngine is an open-source Game Engine being developed in C++ and its primary focus is on facilitating development of 3D games, in particular RPG or Open World games. It is developed by an individual developer as a long-term fun project. The engine is supposed to be made cross-platform. (Depends on the Developer :smile: )

## Features
Currently the Engine is under development(see dev branch) and so there are no working features implemented completely.

## Current Development Plans?
* Basic Rendering System and subsystems
* Integrating a Physics system
* UI and other features
* Bug Fixing
* Performance Improvement
* Documentation
* Scripting
* A whole lot of other things which even I don't know about for now.

## What to expect of the Engine?
* Not Unreal or Unity
* Good features and Great many Bugs
* Simple To Use
* Decent UI
* Supports a specific genre of games

## Third-Party Libraries Used:
No software is built entirely from scratch (exceptions do exist but that's beside the point :confused: ) and so CreyonEngine also uses third party libraries for its development and more will be added as development progresses. Below is the list of libraries used with their name, developer name, and link to their official site/ github repository. Do check them out and support them, most are open source.

Currently, no contributions or pull-requests cause there is lot of development to be done.
