# CreyonEngine
CreyonEngine is an open-source Game Engine being developed in C++ and its primary focus is on facilitating development of 3D games, in particular RPG or Open World games. It is developed by an individual developer as a long-term fun project. The engine is supposed to be made cross-platform. (Depends on the Developer :smile: )

## Features
Currently the Engine is under development(see dev branch) and so there are no working features implemented completely.

## Current Development Plans?
* Basic Rendering System and subsystems
* Physics System and subsystems
* UI and other features
* Bug Fixing
* Performance Improvement
* Documentation
* Scripting
* A whole lot of other things which even I don't know about for now.

## What to expect of the Engine?
* Not Unreal or Unity
* Good features and Great many Bugs
* Simple To Use
* Decent UI
* Supports a specific genre of games

## Platforms:
* PC - Windows

## Contributions
Currently, no contributions or pull-requests cause there is lot of development to be done.
